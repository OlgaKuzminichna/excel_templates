# üìÇ VBA Excel Form Template for Data Entry & SharePoint Integration  

## üìå Overview  

This **Excel VBA-based form** was created for a simulated use case where users can **enter structured data, select a PDF file, and store everything in an Excel sheet while managing files in a specified folder (local or SharePoint).**  

Here is how the main Overview looks, featuring two buttons at the top and displaying the previously entered information, including links to the associated files:

   - **All entered data is recorded** in the Excel sheet.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ File Handling Logic  

- **The selected PDF is automatically moved** to a specified storage location.  
- **Original file is deleted from its initial folder** to ensure a single source of truth.  
- The target folder can be either:  
  - ‚úÖ **A local directory** (as shown in the example).  
  - ‚úÖ **A SharePoint folder** (requires integration‚Äîsee details below).  

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Duplicate Entry Prevention  

- The VBA script **checks for duplicate Titles** before saving data.  
- If a duplicate is found, an error message appears, preventing redundant entries.  
- This feature is useful for real-world applications where unique record-keeping is required (e.g., project tracking, contract management).  

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Customization Options  

- **Form Labels** ‚Üí Feel free to rename labels in the form as needed.  
- **Input Fields** ‚Üí The form includes a variety of field types to demonstrate versatility:  
  - **Text field** ‚Üí Title  
  - **Date picker** ‚Üí Date  
  - **Number input** ‚Üí Duration  
  - **Dropdown lists** ‚Üí Category, Organisation  
  - **Multi-selection list** ‚Üí Project Lead (supports adding new entries)
  - You can create **dependent dropdowns**, where the second dropdown‚Äôs options depend on the first dropdown‚Äôs selection.  
      Example: If **Category** = `"IT & Software"`, then the **Subcategory** dropdown should only show:  
         - `"Software Development"`  
         - `"Cybersecurity"`  
         - `"IT Support"`  
         
         ```vba
         Private Sub Category_Change()
             Dim selectedCategory As String
             selectedCategory = Me.Category.Value
         
             ' Clear Subcategory dropdown
             Me.Subcategory.Clear
         
             ' Populate Subcategory based on Category selection
             Select Case selectedCategory
                 Case "IT & Software"
                     Me.Subcategory.AddItem "Software Development"
                     Me.Subcategory.AddItem "Cybersecurity"
                     Me.Subcategory.AddItem "IT Support"
                 Case "Marketing"
                     Me.Subcategory.AddItem "SEO"
                     Me.Subcategory.AddItem "Content Strategy"
                     Me.Subcategory.AddItem "Branding"
                 Case "Finance"
                     Me.Subcategory.AddItem "Accounting"
                     Me.Subcategory.AddItem "Investments"
                     Me.Subcategory.AddItem "Budgeting"
             End Select
         End Sub
         ```
- **Sheet Protection** ‚Üí  
  - To **prevent accidental edits**, consider **protecting the sheet** while allowing VBA modifications.  
  - **Important:** If the sheet is protected, don‚Äôt forget to **add a password in the VBA code** for unlocking before data entry.  
-  **Send an email notification when a new entry is saved**

#### **VBA Code to Send Email via Outlook**  
```vba
Sub SendEmailNotification()
    Dim OutlookApp As Object
    Dim MailItem As Object
    Dim recipient As String
    Dim subject As String
    Dim body As String

    ' Set email details
    recipient = "recipient@example.com" ' Change to desired recipient
    subject = "New Entry Created in Excel Form"
    body = "A new entry has been added to the Excel database." & vbNewLine & _
           "Title: " & Range("A2").Value & vbNewLine & _
           "Category: " & Range("B2").Value & vbNewLine & _
           "Check the document at: " & Range("C2").Hyperlinks(1).Address

    ' Create Outlook application and send email
    Set OutlookApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    Set MailItem = OutlookApp.CreateItem(0)
    
    With MailItem
        .To = recipient
        .Subject = subject
        .Body = body
        .Send
    End With
    
    ' Cleanup
    Set MailItem = Nothing
    Set OutlookApp = Nothing
End Sub
```


## üìÅ How to Save Files in SharePoint Instead of Local Folder  

If you want to store files in **SharePoint instead of a local folder**, follow these modifications:  

### üîπ Find the SharePoint Document Library URL  

1. Open the SharePoint folder where you want to save files.  
2. Copy the full **URL path** to the document library.  

### üîπ Update VBA Code to Use SharePoint Path  

Modify the file move logic in VBA:  

```vba
'UserForm:
If Not (CheckSharedDrive(driveLetter)) Then
  MapSharepointToDrive (driveLetter)
End If

reName = "https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite/Shared Documents/YourFolder/" & title & ".pdf"
NameExcel = "https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite/Shared Documents/YourFolder/" & title & ".pdf"

'Store the User Name
'  AddedBy = Application.UserName
'  With Sheets("Overview").Cells(65536, 7).End(xlUp)
'    .Offset(1, 0) = AddedBy
'    .Font.Name = "RWE Sans"
'  End With

sharepointFolder = "https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite/Shared Documents/YourFolder/"

'Modul2:
x = Shell("C:\Windows\Explorer.exe /n,/e,""A:/YourSite/Shared Documents/YourFolder/""", vbNormalFocus)
